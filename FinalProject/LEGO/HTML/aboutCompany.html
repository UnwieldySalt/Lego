    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h2>Our Origin</h2>
    <p>The Lego company is very close to heart here. Lego were founded in 1932 by my great-grandfather Ole Kirk Christiansen, a master carpenter from Billund
    in Denmark. He started making wooden toys in his workshop and named the company Lego in 1934, meaning “play well” in his mother tongue Danish.
    The first Lego blocks were introduced in 1949 and have since become a staple in children's toy collections worldwide.
    As we grew, my grandfather, Godtfred Kirk Christiansen, took over the reins and introduced the Lego System of Play in 1955,
    which allowed for the creation of more complex structures. We has since expanded our product line to include a wide range of toys,
    games, and theme parks. Today, Lego is one of the most successful game brands in marketing history and continues to inspire creativity
    and imagination in children and adults alike.</p>

    <h2>Our Goal</h2>
    <p>At Lego, our goal is to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow through the power of play. We believe that children should be given the
    freedom to explore their creativity and imagination, and we strive to provide them with the tools to do so. 
    Our core values include imagination, creativity, fun, learning, and caring. We believe that these values are essential for
    children's development and growth, and we aim to incorporate them into everything we do.</p>
