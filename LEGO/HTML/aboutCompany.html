    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h2 class="h2">Our Origin</h2>
    <br>
    <fieldset>The Lego company was founded in 1932 by Ole Kirk Christiansen, a master carpenter from Billund in Denmark. The first 
    Lego blocks were introduced in 1949 and have since become a staple in children's toy collections worldwide. As the company grew, 
    Godtfred Kirk Christiansen took over the reins and introduced the Lego System of Play in 1955, which allowed for the creation of 
    more complex structures. We have since expanded our product line to include a wide range of toys, games, and theme parks. Today, 
    Lego is one of the most successful game brands in marketing history and continues to inspire creativity and imagination in both children
    and adults alike.

    <h2 class="h2">Our Goal</h2>
    <br>
    <fieldset >At Lego, our goal is to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow through the power of play. We believe that children should be given the
    freedom to explore their creativity and imagination, and we strive to provide them with the tools to do so. 
    Our core values include imagination, creativity, fun, learning, and caring. We believe that these values are essential for
    children's development and growth, and we aim to incorporate them into everything we do.
    </fieldset>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2 class="h2">Future Of LEGO</h2>
    <br>
    <fieldset>At LEGO, we thrive to make the company what Ole wanted it to be. Ole aspired to make LEGO seem limitless to meet children's creativity.
    As we move forward, we respect Ole's dream here at LEGO and aim to expand the boundaries of human imagination.
